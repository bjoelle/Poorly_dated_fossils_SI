It is composed of the following files:
- Penguins_Mitogenomes.nex and Penguins_morpho_all.nex contain the molecular and morphological alignments respectively, obtained from Thomas et al. 2020
- taxa_original.tsv contains the fossil age ranges used in the original analysis from Thomas et al. 2020
- taxa_x_y.tsv contain the modified age ranges with imprecise-date fossils, indexed by the interval used for imprecise-date fossils (x, 1 or 2) and the proportion of imprecise-date fossils (y, 0.5 or 1)
- fossils_lists.RData contains data about the intervals used including the interval bounds and the list of fossils covered by each interval
