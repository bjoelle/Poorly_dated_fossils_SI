This folder contains the files used to calibrate the values of the simulation parameters.
- concat_full_bol.log was provided by the authors of Brunke et al. 2017 and used for the speciation and molecular clock rate estimates
- morpho.run1.p was provided by Dagmara Żyła (unpublished analysis using the alignment in Morphology_only.nex) and used for the morphological gamma shape parameter
- molecules_single_partition.run1.p was provided by Dagmara Żyła (unpublished analysis using the alignment in Molecules_only.nex) and used for the molecular gamma shape and frequencies parameters
