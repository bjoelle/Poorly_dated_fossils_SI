This folder contains the data related to the simulated crinoids datasets.

It contains the following folders:
- data_source contains the log files used to calibrate parameters of the simulation
- datasets contains .RData files with the simulated trees, sequences and fossil occurrences for all simulation conditions 
- results contains summaries of the results on the simulated datasets.

All files in datasets and results are indexed by the proportion of imprecise-date fossils (prop, 0.1, 0.3 or 0.5), the multiplier used for the age range of precise date fossils (age, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3) and optionally by the simulation condition (relaxed = relaxed clock, ss = less fossils, mrphdisc = realistic characters).
